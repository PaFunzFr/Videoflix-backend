test_videos_api_and_signals.py
------------------------------
Integration and unit tests for video API endpoints and signal-based background processing.


These tests verify that:
    • Authenticated users can successfully retrieve video lists and HLS playlist files.
    • Unauthorized requests to video endpoints are properly rejected (HTTP 401).
    • The video post_save signal automatically enqueues background tasks for video
      conversion (480p, 720p, 1080p) and master playlist creation via RQ.


The tests ensure correct behavior of the video-serving API, secure authentication via
Cookie-based JWT, and reliable asynchronous task scheduling through Django signals.
